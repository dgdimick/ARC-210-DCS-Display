# Power and future button lighting

The painted buttons supplied with the PC Flights panel used for this build are opaque: light will not pass through them, so LEDs behind them would not illuminate their legends. Future backlighting would also require suitable light-transmitting replacement buttons.

The Teensy is powered by USB, and **TFT VCC connects directly to the Teensy's 3.3 V rail** (`TEENSY_3V3`, U1 pad 15). TFT brightness at 3.3 V has been confirmed satisfactory. The external protected 5 V input and Main Board JP1 power selector have been removed. C5 (470 µF) and C6 (0.1 µF) have been removed to match the tested direct Teensy-to-TFT wiring. C1/C2 and R1/R2 remain as the rotary-input filters. Keep total external 3.3 V consumption within PJRC's recommended 250 mA maximum; brightness confirmation is not a current measurement.

Future button lighting would require a separate power and driver design, suitable light-transmitting buttons, and a new Button LED PCB. The current Main Board has no external lighting-power circuit. This lighting revision is not currently planned; the other radio projects remain the priority.
