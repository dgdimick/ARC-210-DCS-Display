# ARC-210 Radio Control Panel for DCS A-10C II

**Updated Aug 15 2025**

This project replicates the look and functionality of the ARC-210 radio (VHF/UHF) used in the A-10C II Warthog module for Digital Combat Simulator (DCS). It is intended for use with a physical control panel powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller.

ðŸ”— [See the official DCS website](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/) for the game.

## Features

- Realistic interface modeled after the ARC-210 radio
- Powered by two ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 N16R8 boards â€” uses USB or 5V supply
- ILI9488 3.5" SPI TFT display (480x320) â€” powered by the control board
- Support for digital rotary encoders, rotary switches, and momentary switches
- Optional WS2812 LEDs for backlighting
- DCSBIOS integration for in-game control and feedback
- Red screen when DCSBIOS link has not been activated
- RESET button resets both ESP32-S3 chips
- ESP32-S3 chips can be updated via WiFi

  *Note: Placing both Rotary Switches in postion 8 and holding the GPS button for 5 seconds will force a reboot launching the over the air upgrade - code will need to be changed by user - wifi_config.h will need to be configured by the user* 

## Hardware

- **LEDs:** Up to 50 WS2812 RGB LEDs

- **Optional:** Arduino Mega 2560 version also supported â€” code changes required for display output; pins need to be changed and the TFT_eSPI library used

## Software

- Written in Arduino C++
- Uses `ILI9488-ESP32S3.h` custom display driver

  *Note: Do not use TFT_eSPI due to ESP32 compatibility issues*

## Directories

- `ARC-210/`: Main source code and sketches
- `ARC-210/PCBs/`: KiCad files and Gerbers for button board and ESP32-S3 control board
- `ARC-210/Firmware/`: INO source files
- `ARC-210/Docs/`: Schematics, diagrams, and images
- `ARC-210/Supporting STL's/`: 3D-printable parts such as knobs, bezels, brackets, and mounts

## New: Supporting STL's

The `Supporting STL's` directory includes:
- **Knobs** for rotary encoders and rotary switches
- **Mounting hardware** for the TFT screen and PCBs
- **Brackets** for panel alignment

All STLs are print-ready and designed for FDM printers with 0.4mm nozzles. SLA printers may require scaling adjustments.
