Supporting 3D files for ARC-210 project

All knobs will fit if used with the parts listed on the main page; some may be a snug fit.

The 3.5 SPI display mount does not have any mount points, it's just a bracket that will
hold the display in the PCB and the front face. Right now it will need to be Hot Glued
in place, I know this is wonky. I will modify this so it's a proper mount later.
