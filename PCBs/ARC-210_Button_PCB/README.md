## Board Versions

**Note:** Diodes are optional, the firmware looks at the first button pushed and ignores all other buttons
          until the first button is released.

- **V1.1 and V1.2** Pulled PCB's designs due to design errors

- **V2.0** is the current version, the inside of the circle on the PCB may need to be cut out, I wasn't able to have it manufactured with the cut due to the design becoming too complex for the PCB house.
