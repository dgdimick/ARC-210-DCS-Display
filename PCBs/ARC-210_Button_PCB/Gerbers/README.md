## Board Versions

- V1.1 will work fine, it may require a bit of sanding on the left side
for it to fit the rotary switch, there traces are far enough away from the edge to
allow for this.

- V1.2 has had the board modified to allow it to fit without any modification.
I also moved the traces to get rid of some of the wonky ways KiCad laid them out.
