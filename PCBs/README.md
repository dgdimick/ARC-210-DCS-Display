# PCB's for the ARC 210

**Updated Sept 25th 2025**

This project replicates the look and functionality of the ARC-210 radio (VHF/UHF) used in the A-10C II Warthog module for Digital Combat Simulator (DCS). It is intended for use with a physical control panel powered by an Teensy 4.1 board.

ðŸ”— [See the official DCS website](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/) for the game.

## Features

- Realistic interface modeled after the ARC-210 radio
- Powered by 1 Teenys 4.1
- ILI9488 3.5" SPI TFT display (480x320) â€” powered by the control board
- Support for digital rotary encoders, rotary switches, and momentary switches
- DCSBIOS integration for in-game control and feedback
- Red screen when DCSBIOS link has not been activated

The current PCB for the Teensy Controller board is Version 1.0 - I just submitted it for manufacture, I expect it to work fine, however, you may want to wait a month for it to be fully tested.

The current PCB for the Button Board has been finalized at Version 2.0 - It has been tested and works fine.
