These are the images of the PCB's I've released

Button Board V1.1 will work fine, it may reguire a bit of sanding on the left side
for it to fit the rotary swaitch, there traces are far enough away from the edge to
allow for this.

Version 1.2 has had some had these board modified to allow it to fit without any modifactions.
I also moved the traces to get rid of some of the wanky ways KiCad layed them out.
